Mission goal
============

You encounter the princess, who appears to be in a foul mood. She proceeds to explain that her bedroom was excessively hot last night and the king remains skeptical of her claims.
She insists that a magic book in Merlin's office holds records detailing the historical temperature data within the castle, which could substantiate her complaint.
Read this book and save the princess room temperature (at this specific date written in the magic book) in a file called "temperature.txt", in the drawer...
